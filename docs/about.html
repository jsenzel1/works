        For the time being, I'm somewhat tired of formal 3rd person artist statements, so
        let's try doing this casually
        <br>
        <br>
        I often struggle with condensed descriptions like this because part of what makes my practice mine, is that I am
        an exceedingly multidisciplinary artist. I'm originally a composer, and these days I'm creating a lot of
        interactive and New Media Art using a wide spectrum of mediums from fully physical (the envelope manifesto),
        digital/physical hybrid (urban walks) to fully digital (seasons, pausa).
        <br>
        <br>
        I like playing, exploring, and wondering, and these themes are often reflected in my work using emergence,
        non-linearity, and participant creation. I enjoy constructing a framework in which people interact, where the
        enjoyment of the work is not provided directly by me, but by what you uniquely experience based on broad
        instruction and systemic design.
